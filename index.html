   <p>Using I'll-Serve-Soup has fixed issues in my kitchen with communication between management and employees. I have saved so much money and time being able to look at my supplies on the go!

   <p>As a lead chef in my restaurants, I already have so much to handle. Using this software has taken so much stress off my workday. 
     I am thankful that it's an easy to use application sense I am not that tech savvy of an individual</br>-Anonymous </p>

   <p>As a manager at a local food drive, I am thankful that I don't have to rely on someone to ensure food levels when I am not in the kitchen. With I'll-Serve-Soup, 
     I can easily add food and take it away as items come in our store with a touch of a button!</br>-Anonymous</p>
